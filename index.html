            <p>Euler’s number has a value of <no> 2.718…</no>, however just like Pi, it is an irrational number, meaning that it cannot be written as a fraction and that it has a decimal expansion which will continue forever without repetition. Euler’s number e has become famous for two main reasons: firstly, it is used in lots of important real-life situations, and secondly it has many interesting mathematical properties. This makes <span>e</span> a fascinating and useful number for scientists, engineers, and mathematicians alike.</p></div>

            <p>The exponential constant is a significant mathematical constant and is denoted by the symbol <span>‘e’</span>. It is approximately equal to <no>2.718.</no> This value is frequently used to model physical and economic phenomena, mathematically, where it is convenient to write <span>e</span>. The exponential function can be easily described using this constant, for example, y = ex so as the value of x varies, then we can calculate the value of y.</p>

            <h2>How to calculate the value of <i>e</i>?</h2>  
            <p>We have learned till now about the Mathematical constant or Euler’s constant or base of the natural logarithm, e and the values of e. The expression for e to calculate its value was given as;</p> 
            <img src="one.png" class="formula one">
            <p>Now, if we solve the above expression, we can find the approx value of constant e.</p>
            <img src="two.png" class="formula one">
            <spam>Or</spam>
            <no>e = 1/1 + 1/1 + 1/2+ 1/6 + 1/24 + 1/120 + ……</no>
            <p>Now, taking the first few terms only.</p>
            <no>e = 1/1 + 1/1 + 1/2+ 1/6 + 1/24 + 1/120</no>
            <no>e = 2.71828</no>
            <p>Therefore,<b> the value of e is equal to 2.71828 or e ≈ 2.72.</b></p>

            <h2>Where is Euler’s Number  <i>e</i>used in the real world?</h2>  
            <p>Compound Interest is not the only practical use for <span>e</span>. In fact, Euler’s number <span>e</span>, the function <no>y=<span>e</span><sup>x</sup></no>, and the natural logarithm with base e (ln <span>x</span> ) appear a lot in real-life processes. The main reason for this is that the exponential function <no>y=<span>e</span><sup>x</sup></no> can be used to describe growth and decay.</p>
            <ul>Examples include:
                <li>How populations grow</li>
                <li>How temperature changes as materials heat up or cool down</li>
                <li>Radioactive decay of particles</li>

            <h2>Euler’s Number <i>(e)</i> and Compound Interest</h2>  
            <p>Euler’s Number <span>e</span> was first discovered by Jacob Bernoulli in the 17<sup>th</sup> Century when he studied the problem of Compound Interest.</p>
            <p>Imagine you have £1 and that you get interest twice a year at a rate of 50%.</p>
            <p>At the end of the year you would end up with £1 <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctimes+%5Cleft%28+1+%2B+%5Cfrac+%7B+1+%7D+%7B+2+%7D+%5Cright%29+%5Ctimes+%5Cleft%28+1+%2B+%5Cfrac+%7B+1+%7D+%7B+2+%7D+%5Cright%29+%3D+&bg=ffffff&fg=7b7979&s=0")>£<img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=1+%5Ctimes+%5Cleft%28+1+%2B+%5Cfrac+%7B+1+%7D+%7B+2+%7D+%5Cright%29+%5E+%7B+2+%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=7b7979&s=0"> = £2.25</p>
            <p>Now imagine you have £1 and you get interest 12 times per year, or every month at a rate of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac+%7B+1+%7D+%7B+12+%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=7b7979&s=0"> (8.3%)</p>

            <p>Now imagine you have £1 and you get interest 365 times per year, or every day at a rate of <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cfrac+%7B+1+%7D+%7B+365%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=7b7979&s=0"> (0.2739….%)</p>
            <p>At the end of the year you would end up with £1 <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Ctimes+%5Cleft%28+1+%2B+%5Cfrac+%7B+1+%7D+%7B+365+%7D+%5Cright%29+%5E+%7B+365+%7D+%3D&bg=ffffff&fg=7b7979&s=0"> £2.714567482</p>
            <p>Jacob Bernoulli asked an important question: what would happen if you received interest so often that you received it continuously?</p>
            <p>In fact, what is the value of&nbsp; <img src="https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=%5Cleft%28+1+%2B+%5Cfrac+%7B+1+%7D+%7B+n+%7D+%5Cright%29+%5E+%7B+n+%7D&bg=ffffff&fg=7b7979&s=0"> as n tends towards infinity?</p>
            <p>You might already have guessed the answer, just by looking at our example where n=365, which is already getting quite close to <span>e</span> .&nbsp; This brings us to the most well known way of calculating <span>e</span>:</p>

            <h2>Don’t forget about <no><span>e</span><sup>iπ</sup>=-1</no></h2>  
            <p>No discussion about Euler’s Number e would be complete without mentioning one of the most famous equations in mathematics called Euler’s Equation:</p>
            <no><span>e</span><sup>iπ</sup>=-1</no>
            <p>Euler’s Equation shows that i, π and e are connected to one another. This is really surprising, given that π comes from looking at the properties of a circle, and e arises from situations which have nothing to do with circles such as compound interest. Euler’s Equation shows that e is more than just a useful number which can be used by scientists to model the real world – it is a fascinating number in its own mathematical right.</p>
